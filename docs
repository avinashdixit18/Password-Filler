The objects are the building blocks of the object oriented programming language. A programmer may use multiple
objects belonging to different classes in some situations, which may have some relationship among themselves as they share some common features. 

Let us consider an example of a program containing objects of two different classes, Car and Motorcycle, 
for maintaining car and motorcycle information, respectively. Both Car and Motorcycle classes exhibit some 
relationship as both are vehicles and share some common features like speed, engine specification, etc.
To represent the relationship between classes, we use the concept of Inheritance.
